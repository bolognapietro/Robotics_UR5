To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ‚úÖ Verify your PR is {\bfseries{up-\/to-\/date}} with {\ttfamily ultralytics/yolov5} {\ttfamily master} branch. If your PR is behind you can update your code by clicking the \textquotesingle{}Update branch\textquotesingle{} button or by running {\ttfamily git pull} and {\ttfamily git merge master} locally.
\end{DoxyItemize}




\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ‚úÖ Verify all Y\+O\+L\+Ov5 Continuous Integration (CI) {\bfseries{checks are passing}}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ‚úÖ Reduce changes to the absolute {\bfseries{minimum}} required for your bug fix or feature addition. \+\_\+\char`\"{}\+It is not daily increase
  but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is.\char`\"{}\+\_\+ ‚Äî Bruce Lee

If you spot a problem with Y\+O\+L\+Ov5 please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We\textquotesingle{}ve created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide {\bfseries{code}} that they can easily understand and use to {\bfseries{reproduce}} the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a \href{https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/}{\texttt{ minimum reproducible example}}. Your code that reproduces the problem should be\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ‚úÖ {\bfseries{Minimal}} ‚Äì Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
\item ‚úÖ {\bfseries{Complete}} ‚Äì Provide {\bfseries{all}} parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
\item ‚úÖ {\bfseries{Reproducible}} ‚Äì Test the code you\textquotesingle{}re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addition to the above requirements, for \href{https://ultralytics.com/}{\texttt{ Ultralytics}} to provide assistance your code should be\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ‚úÖ {\bfseries{Current}} ‚Äì Verify that your code is up-\/to-\/date with the current Git\+Hub \href{https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master}{\texttt{ master}}, and if necessary {\ttfamily git pull} or {\ttfamily git clone} a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
\item ‚úÖ {\bfseries{Unmodified}} ‚Äì Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this repository. \href{https://ultralytics.com/}{\texttt{ Ultralytics}} does not provide support for custom code ‚ö†Ô∏è.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the üêõ {\bfseries{Bug Report}} \href{https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/new/choose}{\texttt{ template}} and provide a \href{https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/}{\texttt{ minimum reproducible example}} to help us better understand and diagnose your problem.\hypertarget{md_vision_yolov5_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md_vision_yolov5_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md9}
